This is a project of a mobile app with following functionalities:
-campaigns that businesses can run and users will apply to. 
When chosen, users get some sort of benefits, eg free meals at restauants, free entries to clubs etc. 
Businesses in turn get promoted on social media, mainly (but not limited to) on this app in section of previous campaigns info. 
Users then are likely to spread the word to their friends and accumulate new customers for those businesses. 
This is very similar to influencers but differs in the fact that users are not global but local, co they are potentially better customers and will share it to people nearby, creating customers who will visit the business regularly instead of millions of followers who are spread across whole earth and are not likely to ever visit the business. 
Not all functionalities are coded.
